          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Amzat, an aspiring web developer. I am 21 years old and I
            am in my final year of studying Chemical Engineering in the
            university. Sometime ago, I developed an interest in blockchain
            technology. Being someone who had never even written a line of code,
            getting into tech seemed like an impossible task, but I was
            determined. I have now spent the last six months learning frontend
            development as a first step to becoming a web developer. I have now
            learnt HTML, CSS, and I am currently learning Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along my learning path, I was required to build some interesting
            projects. I made this website so I can show you some of those
            projects. I hope you like them!
